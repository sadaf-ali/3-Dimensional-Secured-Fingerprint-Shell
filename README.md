# 3-Dimensional-Secured-Fingerprint-Shell
The minutiae points information of a fingerprint is generally saved directly in the database as a template for the user. It has been deduced through numerous research works that the original fingerprint of a user can be obtained from the minutiae points information. As the databases are prone to various attacks, their security becomes a huge concern in fingerprint based authentication systems. Hereby, a novel technique has been introduced which is based on the modification of the minutiae attributes. The user template generated through the proposed technique is extremely secure and robust. The proposed technique achieved 1.63%, 1%, and 2.43% EER under stolen-key attack scenario for FVC2002 DB1, FVC2002 DB2, and FVC2002 DB3 fingerprint databases respectively. The proposed technique achieved 0% EER under different-key scenario. Highly encouraging results are obtained that show the viability and effectiveness of the proposed technique.
